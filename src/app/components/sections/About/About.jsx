            As the youngest computer enthusiast in my household, I was the
            default teen-ag-er for troubleshooting everyoneâ€™s faulty gadgets.
            <br />
            <br />
            With time I developed a lot of interest in anything computer-related
            and eventually got good at it. So when it was time to make plans for
            College, after high school, I chose to study Computer Science and
            engineering.
            <br />
            <br />
            Circa 2017, I started my first startup. I started my first
            e-commerce store, subsequently followed by an entertainment website,
            and a website about finance. I faced many challenges throughout but
            my passion kept me focused.
            <br />
            <br />
            Today, I stand proud of the decision I took. The experiences and
            knowledge I have acquired offered me the privilege of working with a
            start-up company, assisting my friends with their projects, and
            creating futuristic ideas on my own.
